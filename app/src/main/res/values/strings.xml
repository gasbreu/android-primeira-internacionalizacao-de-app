        ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\n
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore —\n
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n
        "Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door —\n
        Only this and nothing more".\n
